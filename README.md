# Speed.Codes Academy App

This is my first published flutter project.
It was for the company in scope of my final exam to become a developer.

As the company needed an daily management application for its academy I was assigned to design and develop an app which includes a newsletter page, chat page and a calender page. You are able to login if you have already a profile or you can sign in.
It starts with an animated splash screen which shows the company logo.

The purpose of the app is to guarantee a smooth communication between the academy lecturers and the students, as well as managing deadlines and events with the help of the calender.
